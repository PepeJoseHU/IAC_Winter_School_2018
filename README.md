# IAC Winter School 2018: unsupervised machine learning algorithms in Astronomy
The XXX Winter School of Astrophysics on Big Data in Astronomy: http://www.iac.es/winterschool/2018/.

This repository contains the slides from the lectures I gave during the school, and python tutorials.
The topics I covered in the school:
1. **Introduction to Unsupervised Learning:** The main differences between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, and the basic anatomy of unsupervised learning algorithms. 
2. **Clustering Algorithms:** K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian mixture models.
3. **Decision Trees and Random Forests:**: decision trees and their advantages and disadvantages, ensemble methods, random forest, probabilistic random forest, unsupervised random forest for distance assignment.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms:**: principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP),auto-encoders, self-organizing maps (SOM), and PINK. Specifically, we discussed methods with which we can interpret the low-dimensional output of such algorithms.
5. **Outlier Detection Algorithms:** anomaly detection with supervised learning algorithms, isolation forests, and unsupervised random forests for distance estimation.
